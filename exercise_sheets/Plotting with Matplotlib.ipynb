    "There are three ways of plotting graphs with matplotlib. This makes it a little confusing but one needs to be familiar with all the ways, as you will come across all of them being used. As we will see, all these methods do the same thing: creating a figure object with axes objects, and the plotting graphs on the axes objects within the figure. They even work in the exact same way, the only difference being the explicitness of detail used in the code for each.\n",
