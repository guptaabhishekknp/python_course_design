    "0) Write a code to find if the sum of divisors of a number lesser than itself, equals that number. \n",
    "\n",
    "0) Given the dictionary of grades of students below, calculate their GPA.\n",
    "\n",
    "d = {\"Sam\": ]'A',' A-', 'C-', 'B'],\n",
    "\"Nick\": ['C', 'C-', 'B-', 'C+'],\n",
    "\"Kevin\": ['B', 'A', 'C', 'B'],\n",

    "1) Write a function that takes a list of floating point numbers, and another floating point number and adds the number to all the ones in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Write a function that takes a tuple, representing m and c in the equation y=mx+c and returns the x-intercept, if there is no x-intercept it returns False.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Write a function that takes a string and returns the reversed string.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Write a function which takes two strings and returns True if they are anagrams and False otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Write a function that takes input as list of 4-lists consisting of [name,age,height,weight] and returns a dictionary \"names\":[list of names], \"ages\":[list of ages], \"heights\":[list of heights], \"weights\":[list of weights]\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Write a function that takes a tuple of two floats and returns the position of that the point with those coordinates in the plane. If it lies in a quadrant return \"1st quadrant\", \"2nd quadrant\" etc. If it lies on an axis it returns \"x-axis\" or \"y-axis\". If it is the origin, return \"origin\"\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Write a function that takes two tuples as pair of points and returns the equation of the line joining them as a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "8) Write a function that takes a list of floats and returns a list with the greatest integer lesser than(math.floor()) the absolute values of each.\n",
    "\n",
    "9) Write a function that takes a list of lists and returns the flattened list, that is, a list containing all the items of the lists of the input list.\n",
    "\n",
    "10) Write a function that takes a list of integers representing the coefficients of a polynomial and a integer. Return a tuple with the first entry as the degree of the polynomial and the second entry as True or False depending on whether the number is a zero of the polynomial or not. [This question avoids floats for simplicity]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11) Write a function which takes a list of floating point numbers and returns a dictionary\n",
    "{\"mean\": mean-value of the elements\n",
    " \"median\": ---\n",
    " \"mode\":---\n",
    " \"variance\":---\n",
    " \"max\":---\n",
    " \"min\":---}\n",
    " \n",
    "12) Write a function that takes a list of strings and returns the string sentence formed by concatenating the elements of the list with spaces in between.\n",
    " \n",
    "13) Write a function that takes an angle in degrees as a integer, and returns the following dictionary:\n",
    " \n",
    "{\"radians\": radian value of the angle\n",
    " \"sin\": sine of the angle\n",
    " \"cos\": cosine of the angle\n",
    " \"tan\": tangent of the angle\n",
    " }\n",
    " \n",
    "14) Write a function that takes a pair of integers as a tuple and returns a list of all multiples of 3 between them. If the numbers are equal then it returns 1 or 0 depending on whether it is a multiple of 3 or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "15) Write a function that takes two lists of floats of the same length and returns the euclidean distance between them. If there's a problem with the lists, it returns False.\n",
    "\n",
    "16) Write a function that takes the length of sides of a triangle and returns the area of the triangle which recall is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "Area = $\\sqrt{ p ( p − a ) ( p − b ) ( p − c )}$ where $p = \\frac{a+b+c}{2}$. If the expression in the square root is negative return the string \"Invalid Triangle\"\n",
    "\n",
    "17) Write a function that takes a triple of floats consisting of the dimensions of a cuboid as a tuple and returns a tuple pair consisting of the volume and list of three areas of the faces.\n",
    "\n",
    "18) Write a function which takes an integer number of seconds and returns it as the string \"x days, y hours, z minutes and w seconds\".\n",
    "\n",
    "19) Write a function that takes the movement of a particle as a list of strings of the type: [\"10.1 units forward\", \"3.6 units backward\",\"1.9 units backward\", \"7.8 units forward\"] and returns the final displacement from the position of starting as a string eg \"12.9 units forward\" for the above example.\n",
    "\n",
    "20) Write a function that takes a character and a list of strings and returns a list of True or False depending on whether the character is in the string at each index or not.\n",
