    "4) Plot $\\sin(x)$, $\\sin(x)/x$ and $e^{-x}\\sin(x)$ on the same graph/axes but in different colors and different line styles: continuous, dashed, dotted. Use a legend to indicate which curve corresponds to which function.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Within the same figure, plot four function on four different axes. Functions: $x\\log(|x|)$, $\\frac{1}{1+x^2}$, $\\frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{e^x+e^{-x}}$, $\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1+2x^2}}$\n",

    "<h2> Homework </h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Recall that a number is said to be prime if it is not divisible by any number smaller than itself except 1. Let $\\pi(x)$ denote the number of primes smaller than a given number. The prime number theorem says that the graphs of the functions $\\pi(x)$ and $x/\\ln(x)$ get very close to each other as $x$ increases. In this question, you should plot both these functions on the range [2,10^6] and observe the prime number theorem.\n",

    "\n",
    "![](image2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "These are interlocked semicircles of radius varying from 1 to 7. You may use a different color, but a single arc must be of the same color.\n",
