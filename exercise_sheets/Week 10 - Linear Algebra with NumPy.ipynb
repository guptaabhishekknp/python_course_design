    "2) For the matrix below, find and print the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Also, print the dot products of all pairs of eigenvectors. *Hint:* For dot products of all pairs of eigenvectors, use nested loop to get all pairs of eigenvectors.\n",

    "3) The volume of a parallelopiped formed by three vectors in 3 dimensions can be found by calculating the absolute value of determinant of the matrix formed by the three vectors as rows (or columns, it doesn't matter). Initialize a 10 Ã— 3 array of your choice, with distince entries. Treating it as a collection of vectors in 3-dimensinos, find the triplet of vectors forming the parallelopiped with the largest volume.\n",

    "9) Any matrix can be written as a sum of a symmetric and anti-symmteric matrix using the formula $A=\\frac{A+A^T}{2}+\\frac{A-A^T}{2}$ where the superscript $T$ denotes transpose. The two matrices of the sum are called symmteric and anti-symmteric parts of the matrix. Write a code to print the symmteric and anti symmteric parts of the matrix below:\n",
